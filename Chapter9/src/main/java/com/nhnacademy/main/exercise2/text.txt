World leaders have reacted in different ways to Hamas' attack and Israel's retaliation. Here's a round-up.

United States: President Joe Biden says his country's support for Israel is "rock solid and unwavering". The US has deployed ships and aircraft to the region and said it will send additional munitions to Israel.

UK: Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has pledged "steadfast support" to Benjamin Netanyahu. "We will do everything that we can to help. Terrorism will not prevail," he said.

Iran: President Ebrahim Raisi said Iran supported the Palestinians' right to self-defence and warned that Israel must be held accountable for endangering the region over the years. Hamas is backed by Iran.

Lebanon: Hezbollah, a powerful armed group also backed by Iran, exchanged artillery and rocket fire with Israel on Sunday. This has sparked fears of a wider conflict between Israel and its opponent states.

China: Beijing has called on both sides to "exercise restraint" and "cease fire immediately". State media has reiterated the "two-state solution", which includes establishing an independent State of Palestine.

Russia: The foreign ministry called for an "immediate ceasefire" and negotiations towards "a comprehensive, lasting and long-awaited peace".
