by
the
time
you
set
foot
on
the
campus
of
the
united
states
military
academy
at
west
point
you've
earned
it
the
admissions
process
for
west
point
is
at
least
as
rigorous
as
for
the
most
selective
universities
top
scores
on
the
sat
or
act
and
outstanding
high
school
grades
are
a
must
but
when
you
apply
to
harvard
you
don't
need
to
start
your
application
in
the
eleventh
grade
and
you
don't
need
to
secure
a
nomination
from
a
member
of
congress
a
senator
or
the
vice
president
of
the
united
states
you
don't
for
that
matter
have
to
get
superlative
marks
in
a
fitness
assessment
that
includes
running
push
ups
and
pull
ups
what
is
the
main
advantage
of
binary
search
over
linear
search
what
is
the
main
disadvantage
what
is
meant
by
a
dynamic
array
what
is
the
advantage
of
a
dynamic
array
over
a
regular
array
what
does
it
mean
to
say
that
arraylist
is
a
parameterized
type
assume
that
the
list
is
not
empty
and
that
all
the
items
in
the
list
are
non
null
write
a
code
segment
that
will
find
and
print
the
string
in
the
list
that
comes
first
in
lexicographic
order
write
a
code
segment
that
will
output
the
first
name
last
name
and
hourly
wage
of
each
employee
who
has
been
with
the
company
for
years
or
more
write
two
versions
of
the
code
segment
one
that
uses
a
regular
for
loop
and
one
that
uses
a
for
each
loop
write
a
record
class
to
represent
dates
where
a
date
object
contains
three
integer
fields
giving
the
month
day
and
year
of
the
date
the
canonical
constructor
should
throw
an
exception
if
the
values
for
the
month
and
day
are
not
legal
also
include
a
tostring
method
that
prints
a
date
in
a
form
such
as
computers
get
a
lot
of
their
power
from
working
with
data
structures
a
data
structure
is
an
organized
collection
of
related
data
an
object
is
a
data
structure
combined
usually
with
some
methods
but
this
type
of
data
structure
consisting
of
a
fairly
small
number
of
named
instance
variables
is
just
the
beginning
in
many
cases
programmers
build
complicated
data
structures
by
hand
by
linking
objects
together
we'll
look
at
these
custom
built
data
structures
in
chapter
this
chapter
looks
at
more
basic
data
structures
there
is
one
type
of
data
structure
that
is
so
important
and
so
basic
that
it
is
built
into
every
programming
language
the
array
you
have
already
encountered
arrays
in
section
and
subsection
we
continue
the
study
of
arrays
in
this
chapter
including
some
new
details
of
their
use
and
some
additional
array
processing
techniques
in
particular
we
will
look
at
the
important
topic
of
algorithms
for
searching
and
sorting
an
array
in
section
an
array
has
a
fixed
size
that
can't
be
changed
after
the
array
is
created
but
in
many
cases
it
is
useful
to
have
a
data
structure
that
can
grow
and
shrink
as
necessary
in
section
we
will
look
at
a
standard
class
arraylist
that
represents
such
a
data
structure
an
array
is
a
numbered
sequence
of
items
all
of
the
same
type
a
record
is
another
kind
of
standard
data
structure
like
an
array
a
record
consists
of
a
sequence
of
items
but
in
a
record
the
items
are
referred
to
by
name
instead
of
by
number
and
the
items
can
be
of
different
types
any
object
in
java
can
be
thought
of
as
a
record
in
this
sense
but
java
introduced
records
explicitly
into
the
language
as
a
special
kind
of
class
with
certain
restrictions
we
will
look
at
record
classes
in
section
